# University Management System

                    In this project, I develop an entire management system of a university by implementing the core 
                    concepts of Data Structures & Algorithms such as Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc. 


## Functions
                    This Project will have operations for Administration, Students & Applicants.   
                    -	Admin can appoint teachers, departments, grant admission, etc.  
                    -	Students can check their details like GPA, attendance, etc.   
                    -	Applicants can apply in the University.
